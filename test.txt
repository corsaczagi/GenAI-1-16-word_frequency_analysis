The Old Man and the Sea

The old man went out to sea in his small skiff at dawn. He was old and thin, but his eyes were the color of the sea, brave and undefeated. 
He had not caught a single fish for eighty-four days. But today he felt that luck would turn in his favor. 
Far from the shore, he cast his line. And suddenly, something huge took the bait. It was a great marlin, the largest he had ever seen.
A battle began that lasted for two days and two nights. 
The old man, with his last strength, held the line, his hands cut and bleeding. He talked to the fish, respecting its strength and perseverance. Finally, he won.
But as he sailed back, sharks were drawn by the marlin's blood. They attacked his catch. 
The old man fought desperately, but the sharks were stronger. He brought back to shore only a giant skeleton.
He was defeated, but not broken. He had done what he had to do. And he dreamed of lions on the African coast.
